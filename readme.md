# The Tea Shop
*by Chrystal Adams, Andrew Adkins, Andrew Keddis, and Stefanie Ward*

## A History

We came together as a team and worked as one, coming up with the Tea Shop idea as we all like and enjoy tea. We each worked on our own computers as we all talked through each process on Day 1 and Day 2. We went step by step through the slides and documentation to build. We worked very collaboratively versus individually focused. Stefanie felt most comfortable with having the master repository on GitHub and we all agreed.  

Eric told the class to focus on learning the application and not be concerned about git at this point. He was concerned that would create more issues and take away from learning. However we did push and work with git, but as we were all communicating well, we did not have any merge conflicts or issues. One example of workflow: 

1. cd into folder
2. git clone (for master version)
3. cd into the project folder
4. git checkout -b (name)
5. git pull origin doc
6. code . (to open code editor)
7. make your changes
8. git add .
9. git commit -m "whatever your message is of changes"
10. git push origin doc
11. then Stefanie maintained the master

We stayed in communication via Slack and in person to minimize any potential issues with GitHub. 

We enjoyed working together and each contributed to their own strengths, and worked as a team and ensured everyone was on the same page. Once we had the application operational some wanted to add additional functionality with authentication and Andrew and Andrew worked to completion. 

We are very pleased with our project and potentially add to our project or at least enjoy a cup of tea to relish in a job well done :)
